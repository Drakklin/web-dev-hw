# Assignment-3
You can have just one of each element <head> and <body>. <head> can include titles, styling and metadata, whereas a <body> element contains the elements of the HTML document; that is links or text, images, lists and others.
The difference between the two is fairly well described by noting the difference between using h1 for the size of the text versus its importance, semantic would be the tag used to show level of importance, structural would be the sized one.
As far as work cycle basically, I merely followed directions one after another, and checked back against my work as I went to make sure the required outcome was achieved. However, some things that bothered me included a link that had text that looked bad being too long and a lot of small errors such as using the = sign when a â€“ was requested in the definitions.
