	 <p>There are few requirments to sex tarantulas besides a tarantulas that is.<br>
	    You will need a magnification device such as a hand loop as well as a light source.
		Sexing a tarantula is not easy, however it is not hard given the right situation.<br> 
	    With Mature male tarantulas it is especially obvious as they have a pair of mating hooks<br> 
	    (Tibial apophyss) found on the first pair of legs;<br> (not the pedipals which bear the palpal bulbs).
	    Females have a more rounded <br>appearance and usually shorter legs as well as typically being a larger spider.

		 The best way to sex a tarantula is through the use of its exuvia which is the animals cast off moult.<br>
		 The inside of the exuvia's opithosoma is examined in the area between the bottom set <br>
		 of booklungs. This is the spermathecae A strucure resembling the shape of an &quot;M&quot; or<br> 
		 fence indicates a female The lack of this structure may indicate a male however; this may<br>
		 alternatively indicate a immature female. That is A female specimen that may need further<br>
		 development before the spermathecae is obvious.<br>
