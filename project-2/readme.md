## Project-2
I used almost nothing new this week, but I relatively enjoyed playing with <div> and trying things
out. As far as what I learned in this class about HTML i learned a ton about how to build sites from scratch versus using something like dream weaver.

I am very excited to learn how to use CSS alone to style a website. Really looking forward to being able to do with ATOM what I can do in Dreamweaver!

This weeks work cycle was mad. I actually ended up re-building my site 5 times.... I lost a USB drive containing the HTML and CSS files. After re-building I decided I hated it. So I did it again ...and again. CSS was tricky! But looking back at older sites I have used helped a TON. I also used an off-html CSS page to manipulate the entire site rather than a style tag approach.
