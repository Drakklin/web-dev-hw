# Assignment-2

A version control system is a tool used within programs and other applications that allows the user to track changes. It helps keep records of additions to resources or documents, files or data within a given  
construct of files and directories or even code. It allows a user or creator to find exactly when a problem started by tracking the time and alteration that originated that issue. In addition it allows for users to understand the progress of work they may have association with but have not done themselves in a cooperative project. If part of an open source applications documentation this may also allow for programmer's to modify code effectively and efficiently by pinpointing changes to and the original inclusion of the aspects which they are targeting.

Work cycle was fairly straightforward. Looked at the steps offered in the example media, read my assignment and proceeded. Started with writing up the question answers and the screenshot of that page, followed with the readme alterations. I found some issues with github at first but now I am liking the idea of tracking my work. This would have been a great tool in previous programming classes....wonder why we didn't use it?
